## 1. Top Ten Data Tips
1. Assume data organizing and packaging will take at least two weeks before data publishing
    * Developing technical manuals, checking coding documentation, and cleaning file organization always takes longer than one expects.
    * Also allow at least one week for a kf team member to review your dataset before it is published
2. The aspiration is to develop data that is findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable (FAIR). Remember: ***Partly fair may be good enough***!
3. Documentation is an on-going practice, not a last-minute task. Be sure to:
    * Document the source of your data (e.g., website, date published, date accessed, authors)
    * Document privacy restrictions for your input and output data
    * Document your steps for cleaning/imputing data
    * Constantly add notes/comments within your code as it develops
4. Review the data publishing checklist before you begin organizing your data and code.
5. Always backup your data
6. Choose the right license type for publishing
    * [Taken from DesignSafe Data Management Plan guideline:] Because the DesignSafe Data Depot is an open repository, the following licenses will be offered:
      * For datasets: [ODC-PDDL](http://opendatacommons.org/licenses/pddl/1-0/) and [ODC-BY](http://opendatacommons.org/licenses/by/)	
      * For copyrightable materials (for example, documents, workflows, designs, etc.): [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/) and [CC-BY](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/)
      * For code: any open, non commercial license (for example, [GPL](http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html))
    * Note that datasets are not copyrightable materials.
7. When citing the dataset you published on DesignSafe in any publication of material (whether copyrighted or not), always include the following citation in addition to the citation for your own dataset. This acknowledges the creators of DesignSafe.

Padgett, J.E., Pinelli, J.-P., Stanzione, D., Adair, A., Arduino, P., Brandenberg, S.J., Cockerill, T., Dey, C., Esteva, M., Haan, Jr., F.L., Hanlon, M., Kareem, A., Lowes, L., Mock, S., and Mosqueda, G. 2017. “DesignSafe: A New Cyberinfrastructure for Natural Hazards Engineering,” ASCE Natural Hazards Review, doi:10.1061/(ASCE)NH.1527-6996.0000246.
