## 1. Background and Basics About GitHub

GitHub is a web-based platform used for version control and collaborative software development. It allows multiple people to work on projects simultaneously, track changes, and manage different versions of a project efficiently. Key features of GitHub include:

- **Repositories**: A repository (or "repo") is a storage space where your project files and revision history are kept.
- **Branches**: Branches allow you to work on different versions of a repository at one time.
- **Pull Requests**: Pull requests are proposed changes to a repository submitted by a user and reviewed by others.

To get started with GitHub, you'll need to create an account at [GitHub](https://github.com/).

## 2. Requesting Access to GitHub Repositories

To get access to the CHEER project's GitHub repositories, please send an email to the kf* manager with your GitHub username and the specific repositories you need access to. The kf* manager will then grant you the necessary permissions.

## 3. Repository Templates

We have two templates available for creating new repositories within the CHEER project:

1. **Template-Python_basic**: This template is ideal for simple Python projects. It includes basic project structure and setup files.
2. **Template-Python-best-practice**: This template follows best practices for Python development. It includes a more comprehensive project structure, setup files, and additional tools for code quality and testing.

## 4. Repository Management and Development Workflow

Each thrust within the CHEER project will have one member responsible for managing the repositories related to their thrust. This includes:

- Creating repositories from the provided templates.
- Managing access to the repositories.
- Ensuring that the repositories are organized and maintained properly.

### Development Workflow

1. **Branches**: Developers should create their own branches for working on new features or bug fixes. This keeps the master branch clean and stable.

2. **Pull Requests**: Once a developer has finished their updates on their branch, they should submit a pull request. This is a request to merge their changes into the master branch.

3. **Code Review**: Another member of the thrust must review the code before it is merged into the master branch. This ensures code quality and helps catch any issues early.

Here is a typical workflow:
- **Step 1**: Create a new branch from the master branch.
- **Step 2**: Make changes and commit them to your branch.
- **Step 3**: Push your branch to GitHub.
- **Step 4**: Open a pull request to merge your branch into the master branch.
- **Step 5**: A team member reviews your pull request.
- **Step 6**: Once approved, the branch is merged into the master branch.

Following this workflow ensures that our codebase remains stable and that changes are reviewed before being integrated.
