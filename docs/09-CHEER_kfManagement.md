## 1. 	TACC/DesignSafe User Management

* CHEER team members will email their TACC account user names to you after they set up their TACC accounts
* First, add this user to the DesignSafe CHEER project ([PRJ-4392](https://www.designsafe-ci.org/data/browser/projects/1798100155562136046-242ac117-0001-012/))
  * Go to [DesignSafe website](https://www.designsafe-ci.org/)
  * Sign in using your TACC account
  * Click “Use DesignSafe” > “Data Depot”, go to “My Projects”, then PRJ-4392
  * On the right side of the screen, click “Edit Project”
  * Click “+ Add another Project Member”
  * Add the new TACC username
    * If you’re having trouble finding the person, you can also try to search them by name or email. Confirm that the TACC username shown aligns with the username they emailed to you
    * If you're still having issues adding the user, reach out to TACC staff on the DesignSafe slack (Alexander Fields has been helpful in the past)
  * Click “Update Project” at the bottom of the form
* Then add this user to the CHEER Frontera Allocation on TACC 
  * Go to [TACC website](https://tacc.utexas.edu/)
  * Sign into your TACC account
  * Click on your account name in upper right corner and select “My Dashboard”
  * On the left hand side, click “Projects and Allocations”
  * Click on “DesignSafe Project - CHEER”
  * Click on “Add Users”, search by username, and add user
    * If you’re having trouble finding the person, you can also try to search them by name or email. Confirm that the TACC username shown aligns with the username they emailed to you
  * Note: Only the PI and Allocation Manager listed on the CHEER DesignSafe project can add users to CHEER allocation
  * Note: (I believe) only PI can change Allocation Manager
* Then add the name, TACC user email, and TACC username to the [CHEER User Management spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1N7-ljfhfr1oMW4UdvYIe0z96LApnTx7FFDCKmWlZRx8/edit#gid=0) on the “TACC” tab
  * In the TACC portal, go to the [CHEER project](https://tacc.utexas.edu/portal/projects/62640) and click on the name of the user you added. Copy the name, username, and email to the CHEER User Management spreadsheet
* Lastly, reply with the following email:
  * Thank you for sending your TACC username. You have been added to the CHEER DesignSafe Project for data staging ([PRJ-4392](https://www.designsafe-ci.org/data/browser/projects/1798100155562136046-242ac117-0001-012/)) and the CHEER HPC allocation. For DesignSafe data storage and access, refer to the [CHEER Hub DesignSafe Data Upload Procedures](https://cheer-hub.github.io/cheerkf/#/05b-CHEER_DesignSafe_DataUpload) document. For HPC usage, refer to the [CHEER Hub DesignSafe Computing Procedures](https://cheer-hub.github.io/cheerkf/#/05c-CHEER_DesignSafe_HPC) document. For any other questions, feel free to reach out.

## 2.  GitHub management
* CHEER team members will email their GitHub account user names to you after they set up their GitHub accounts
* Add this to the [CHEER User Management spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1N7-ljfhfr1oMW4UdvYIe0z96LApnTx7FFDCKmWlZRx8/edit#gid=0) on the “GitHub” tab
* Add this user to [CHEER GitHub](https://github.com/CHEER-Hub)
* Set permissions for user
* Reply with the following email:
  * Thank you for sending your GitHub username. You have been added to the CHEER GitHub. Please follow the [CHEER Hub GitHub Procedures](08-CHEER_GitHub.md) for directions on how to use the CHEER GitHub space.

## 3. 	Dealing with sensitive data on DesignSafe
* CHEER members will email you if they have sensitive data that they want to put on a TACC server (per DesignSafe Data Upload Procedures).
* When this happens, set up a meeting with the kf* PI (Chris Lenhardt), team member(s) with the sensitive data, and/or other relevant CHEER members (CHEER PI (Rachel Davidson) or CHEER Integration Lead (Linda Nozick)). 
* Ask the team members to send any relevant information prior to the scheduled meeting, including data agreements, IRB protocols, or other specifics about the data in question.
* Prior to the meeting, also review the information about [TACC’s Protected Data Service](https://tacc.utexas.edu/about/security-and-compliance/protected-data-service/)
* Following the meeting, you may want to set up a meeting with Tim Cockerill (DesignSafe’s TACC rep; cockerill@tacc.utexas.edu; better reached on DesignSafe slack) to advise on how to proceed
* At this point, you may need to formally [submit a request](https://tacc.utexas.edu/about/security-and-compliance/protected-data-service/) for protected data services at TACC
* Ensure all team members understand the plan as to how the sensitive data will be handled on DesignSafe for storage, analysis, and publication purposes

## 4. CHEER Publishing
* You will be responsible for reviewing (most?) all data and code before it's published
* Users will notify you when their product is ready for your review and for publishing
* Data
  * For data publishing on DesignSafe, you may be responsible for moving the data from CHEER's internal DesignSafe project folder to a new project folder on DesignSafe. This new project folder will be published for public consumption and will have a DOI
* Code
  * You may be responsible for publishing code via Zenodo and obtaining a DOI
* Other products with a DOI
  * Make sure all CHEER outputs are cataloged accoriding to the [CHEER Hub Zotero Cataloging procedures](08-CHEER_CatalogProcedures.md)
* Any published product should be documented on the CHEER Zotero according to the [CHEER Hub Zotero Cataloging procedures](08-CHEER_CatalogProcedures.md)


## 5. Ongoing kf* management tasks
* Every December/January, request HPC allocation on TACC for CHEER by following [these instructions](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zPD5QDlQCYVYq05kxZa_b4e-2DFBy9azflNxwp0QLys/edit#heading=h.vkm34wwfb8z3)
* Every January, submit application for [DesignSafe dataset award](https://www.designsafe-ci.org/community/dataset-awards/)
* Ensure documentation of all things is happening consistentlY
* Ensure cataloging is happening
