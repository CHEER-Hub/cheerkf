***

## 1. 	Folder  and file structure
Describe folder structure and file naming scheme

## 2. 	Data Dictionary
Variable name, description, units, data type (can link this with automated documentation produced by python docstring-ing)

## 3. 	Dataset features
Description of modeling options:
* Projection period: 10-, 20-, or 30-years
* Time increment: annual
* Study area: Eastern North Carolina, Houston, TX, or Port Arthur, TX
* Area unit of analysis: census tract, 1 km^2 cell, building
* Analysis method …

## 4. 	Key data outputs
* Brief description of key output file
* File path of key output files 
* [Optional] Suggested application/use 

## 5. 	Case study description
Model parameters
	Projection period
	Time increment of analysis
	Study area 
	Area unit of analysis
	Analysis methods

## 6. 	Limitations
Describe notable limitations (e.g., The model and outputs should only be applied to investigations related to single-family housing units.) 

[Optional]
## 7. 	Additional details about data processing method
Additional information not included in accompanying paper (e.g., outliers excluded, imputation methods, What was considered but not included, and reason for not including <- this can especially be helpful for future researchers, so they don’t have to go down the rabbit holes you did)

## 8. 	Brief description of modeling method
Additional information not included in the accompanying paper
[Optional: What method was considered but not included, and reason for not including <- this can especially be helpful for future researchers, so they don’t have to go down the rabbit holes you did]

## 9. 	How to modify for different applications (for different study area, timeframe, building type, policy evaluation, etc.)
Describe what a user would need to do to apply this method to their analysis of interest
