### Roof Classifier Version Control

| Version | Main Feature(s) | Key Purpose | Upgrades | Resources |
|----------|------------------|--------------|-----------|------------|
| **Inventory-Loss Link (v0) (V0)** | Region-wide, building-by-building hurricane (flood and wind impacts) damage assessment. | Key purposes are:<br>1: Transform the inpout building inventory to the CHEER-Safe native archetypes (determkinistically, i.e., one-time sampling in case of randomness in either of features.<br>2: Extract flood depth and wind ratio per entitity<br>3: Clculate flood, wind, and totoal losses in %. <br>4: Transform the loss data architecture to match with the STARR framework.| – | [Github Page (archived as V0, with documentation within)](https://github.com/CHEER-Hub/Inventory-Loss-link/tree/main)|
