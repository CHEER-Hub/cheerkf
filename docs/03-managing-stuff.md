# Managing Science-y Stuff

Each research thrust will be responsible for managing the relevant research outputs in alignment with the overall CHEER knowledge management strategy.

## Data Management
Data will be managed according to a research readiness level framework. As you move up the framework to higher levels of research readiness, the expectation is that the data will have higher levels of curation and associated metadata and documentation. The aspiration is to develop data that is findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable (FAIR). Remember: Partly fair may be good enough!
### Level 0
### Level 1
### Level 2
### Level 3

## Code Management
Code such as code for models, analysis, and visualization should be version managed using a framework such as Github.  Code may include R, Python, C, or other similar coding languages.

## File Management
Most collaborative work will be done using the shared G-suite tools and stored in the project Google drive.
