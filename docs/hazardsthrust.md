# Description Version 1.0 Dataset
Posting date: 5 Jun 2024

Spatial Resolution: 250 m (on the CREST model computational grid)

Temporal Resolution: N/A.  Min, Max, accumulated fields

Version 1.0 of the Hazards Thrust contains the hazard model output (response) for each hurricane event impacting the North Carolina coast from the first 1000 years of the [STORM stochastic / synthetic dataset](#storm-synthetic-hurricane-dataset) for the present climate. 

Each event's output (eg maximum wind speed) is interpolated onto a consistent equidistant grid with 250 m resolution, which matches the CREST hydrological grid.  This is done to simplify handling of the ADCIRC data (which is otherwise defined on its triangular, variable resolution grid.)  The spatial footprint of the output is shown in this figure.

An example of the maximum water level and maximum open-water wind speed is shown below.

## Units 
 - Wind speeds are m/s, at a vertical level 10-meter, and representing a 10-minute averaging period.  Both open-terrain and open-water are provided.

 - Water levels (columns 5-7) are in meters relative to either the ground / terrain level (for inundation) or MSL for the Surge Water Level. 
Dry values are indicated with a flag of -9999.  

 - Accumulated Precipitation

## Variable definitions:
**Maximum Inundation Level** [meters above terrain, dry == -9999 meters] - Computed by CREST as the highest precipitation-driven water level above ground level.  A value of -9999 indicates no accumulated rainfall at the location.

**Minimum Inundation Level**

**Maximum Surge Water Level** [meters MSL, dry == -9999 meters] - Computed by ADCIRC as the highest water level reached (during the simulation) above the mean sea level (MSL) datum. MSL is the vertical datum used to define the topographic heights and bathymetric depths of the ADCIRC grid nodes.  A value of -9999 indicates no "storm surge" at the location.  I.e., the location never wetted during the simulation.

**Maximum Surge Inundation Level** [meters above terrain, dry == -9999 meters] - Computed by ADCIRC as the maximum water depth reached (during the simulation) above ground level for ADCIRC nodes that are "land" nodes. Ground level in this case is ADCIRC's representation of the topographic height, and may not be the same as the CREST model's topography.  

**Accumulated Precipitation** 

**Maximum Wind Speed, Open Water** [meters/sec open-water] - Computed by the Generalized Asymmetric Holland Model (GAHM) as the maximum wind speed for an individual storm above the open-water level across the entire CREST grid (250 m equidistant grid). 

**Maximum Wind Speed, Open Terrain** [meters/sec open-terrain-adjusted] - Computed by the Generalized Asymmetric Holland Model (GAHM) as the maximum wind speed for an individual storm and adjusted to include the surface roughness of the winds over open-terrain. The adjusted wind speeds are generated for the entire CREST grid (250 m equidistant grid).


# STORM Synthetic Hurricane Dataset
The 10,000 year TC STORM dataset, based on the present climate, is publicly accessible and can be found on the 4TU.Centre for Research Data repository (https://doi.org/10.4121/uuid:82c1dc0d-5485-43d8-901a-ce7f26cda35d). The dataset is split in separate files per basin, with each .txt-file containing 1,000 years of simulations (i.e. 10 files per basin). Each .txt-file consists of a series of arrays, with each array being a single time step (3-hourly) for a synthetic TC. The colmns of the arrays are given in this table:

# Prior Version Notes 
V0: 

# General computational / processing steps
For each track in {STORM dataset for NC, for the present climate}:
1. OU: run CREST to generate:
- Time series of river flows for input into ADCIRC
- Maximum inland inundation field 
- Both posted for UNC to retrieve and place in the computational workflow
2. UNC: run ADCIRC to:
- Compute storm surge using meteorological forcing plus the river flow
- Generate maximum water level surface (water level above MSL)
- Generate maximum overland inundation (water level above ground)
3. UNC: Generate simulation "data package" for downstream uses:
- Interpolate triangular ADCIRC output to CREST grid
- Compute time history of wind velocity and mean sea level pressure from track parameters:
  - Uses a modified Holland vortex model 
  - Evaluated on the CREST grid
  - Computes open-water and open-terrain wind speeds
  - Max wind speeds from time histories of wind velocities
- Package up the max wind, surge and inundation levels into one csv file
